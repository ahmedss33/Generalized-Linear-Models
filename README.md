# Generalized-Linear-Models
There are two important aspects of modeling data like this.
The rst is inference. If we can create an interpretable model, this will help to see what causes an individual to be at risk for heart disease.
This would allow us to see, for example, how much smoking or high blood pressure puts an individual at risk.

The second aspect is prediction. If we are able to create an accurate model to predict a user’s risk of heart disease,
this can be used to save valuable time in a doctor’s day. A model would allow for an individual to have a few quick tests that could be done by a nurse,
like heart rate and blood pressure, and for the individual to give a few self-reported pieces of information like their education level and number of cigarettes smoked per day.
This is compared to having a full examination done by a doctor.
It may be more useful for the doctor’s time to be dedicated to more high risk individuals than for an individual that the model only says has a 5% chance of beingat risk for heart disease.
